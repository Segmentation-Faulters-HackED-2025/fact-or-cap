    <h1>WSGSHAWTY</h1>
    <p>Two days ago, I saw a message in which a member of [insert subreddit here] was discussing how they were a "gooner", 
      and that they were "gooning" to [topic]. This caused me to check UrbanDictionary, as I was not familiar with this slang terminology being used. I was appalled to discover what the word meant, and I immediately banned that user permanently. I assumed it was a one-time event, and that I would not expect to see anyone else admit to doing such a foul act. But I was repulsed by the fact that I had come to witness many more cases of people discussing this. I had immediately banned those many users, with no chance of an unban, but I am afraid that this would simply not cut it. This has let to me making this new rule: DO NOT DISCUSS "GOONING" IN THE SUBREDDIT. It is vile and disgusting, and for people to keep posting about it is an awful tragedy. Any further mention of "gooning", being a "gooner", or having a "goon cave" will immediately lead to you being permanently banned from the Subreddit. Thank you.
